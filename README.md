# GraphicRecipes

This is a small collection of different basic and advanced technqiues for OpenGL and computer graphic algorithms.

## 01-Basic
The basic projects present some applications ranging from building the first triangle application to affine transforms, Bresenham line drawing and simple anti-aliasing.

## 02-BasicLighting [in work]
This chapter of projects deals with basic shading methods: Flat, Gouraud, Phong shading.

## 03-Camera [in work]
A chapter to create a camera approximation and movement with affine transforms, quaternions and maybe some effects.

## 04-Texturing
## 05-GLSLRecipes
## AdvancedLighting
## GlobalIllumination
## GeometricModelling
